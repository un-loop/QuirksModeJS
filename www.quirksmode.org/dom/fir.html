<h2>Image replacement</h2>

<div id="header"></div>

<div class="floater">
<p>There don't seem to be any browser incompatibilities.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://shauninman.com/mentary/past/ifr_an_fir_alternative.php"
	class="external">Shaun Inman's IFR</a> for another technique, this one using Flash.</p>
</div>

<p class="intro">Recently there has been much discussion about the "Fahrner Image Replacement". Although
I liked the concept, I disliked the countless CSS variants that have popped up, because they are inherently
unsafe and hacky. I feel we should use JavaScript instead of CSS. This page explains my script.</p>

<p>The idea of FIR is simple: Initially a page is served with text as the content of its headers. However,
some clever (or not so clever) hacks are applied that hide this text and show an image instead. Theoretically
browsers that can't handle advanced CSS, as well as screen readers, should not execute the replacement.
Therefore the headers would remain accessible under all circumstances.</p>

<h3 id="fir_assumptions">Assumptions</h3>

<p>Unfortunately all CSS variants are making assumptions about screen reader behaviour.
Joe Clark has <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fir/"
	class="external">admirably summarized</a> the problem and his research. Screen readers turn out to
support the CSS bits that everyone assumed they wouldn't support, so they hide the text. They can't show
the image either, so accessibility is severely compromised. Clark's conclusion is that any
CSS variant is inherently unsafe.</p>

<p>When I read a question about using JavaScript to enhance FIR, I realized that everyone was approaching
this problem from the wrong way. We shouldn't use CSS at all to replace text by images. Instead, such a
replacement job is a typical JavaScript task. In fact, it's ridiculously easy.</p>

<p>Nonetheless I'm not any better than the myriad CSS hackers who have preceded me:
I make assumptions about screen readers.
Although to me my assumption seems safer than all others, it may still be totally wrong. That's the chance
you take when writing code for user agents you can't test in.</p>

<p class="accent">My assumption: Screen readers do not download images.</p>

<h3 id="fir_example">Example</h3>

<p>All <code>h3</code> texts on this page are replaced by images, if your browser allows it.
The images are not examples of rarified design beauty. That's because I'm not a designer.</p>

<p>If you switch off images your browser will show normal <code>h3</code>s.</p>

<h3 id="fir_script">The script</h3>

<p>I add an <code>id</code> attribute to any <code>h3</code> that should be affected. It contains
the source of the image to be displayed instead of the text. This script assumes that every <code>h3</code>
with an <code>id</code> should be replaced by an image.</p>

<pre>
&lt;h3 id="fir_script"&gt;The script&lt;/h3&gt;
</pre>

<p>This <code>h3</code> expects the image <code>pix/fir_script.gif</code> for a replacement.</p>

<p>Then I run this script <code>onload</code>.</p>

<pre>
function init()
{
	var W3CDOM = (document.createElement && document.getElementsByTagName);
	if (!W3CDOM) return;
	var test = new Image();
	var tmp = new Date();
	var suffix = tmp.getTime();
	test.src = 'pix/fir_assumptions.gif?'+suffix;
	test.onload = imageReplacement;
}

function imageReplacement()
{
	replaceThem(document.getElementsByTagName('h3'));
}

function replaceThem(x)
{
	var replace = document.createElement('img');
	for (var i=0;i&lt;x.length;i++)
	{
		if (x[i].id)
		{
			var y = replace.cloneNode(true);
			y.src = 'pix/' + x[i].id + '.gif';
			y.alt = x[i].firstChild.nodeValue;
			x[i].replaceChild(y,x[i].firstChild);
		}
	}
}
</pre>


<h3 id="fir_explanation">Explanation</h3>

<p>onload you should run the function <code>init()</code>.</p>

<pre>
function init()
{
</pre>

<p>The first thing we do is checking for W3C DOM support. If it's absent we stop the script.</p>

<pre>
	var W3CDOM = (document.createElement && document.getElementsByTagName);
	if (!W3CDOM) return;
</pre>

<h4>Detecting image support</h4>

<p>Detecting W3C DOM support is not enough, though. We also have to see if the browser supports images. If
it doesn't our script shouldn't run, since it would create all kinds of odd effects.</p>

<p>Therefore we generate an image and set its <code>src</code>. This is a classic
preloading trick: the browser now fetches the image. This is the only support detection we need.
<b>If this test image loads succesfully, the browser supports images</b>. I <em>assume</em>
that a browser that doesn't support images doesn't download them, either.</p>

<p>So we activate the main image replacement routine only when this image has been loaded, ie. after its
<code>load</code> event has taken place.</p>

<p>A browser problem here. If you return to this page by using the Back button, Explorer on Windows does
<em>not</em> fire the <code>onload</code> event of cached images. Therefore we have to make sure that it
fetches a new image every time by adding a suffix that contains the current time in milliseconds.</p>

<p>I don't like this feature of the script, it causes unnecessary HTTP requests, but at the moment I don't
see a way around it.</p>

<pre>
	var test = new Image();
	var tmp = new Date();
	var suffix = tmp.getTime();
	test.src = 'pix/fir_assumptions.gif?'+suffix;
	test.onload = imageReplacement;
}
</pre>

<p>A reader suggested setting a <a href="../js/cookies.html">cookie</a> to keep track of the browser's
image handling. If cookies are turned off, we default back to the suffix. Good idea!</p>

<h4>Defining the target elements</h4>

<p>Once the test image has been loaded, it's safe to do wholesale image replacement. The function
<code>imageReplacement</code> is called. It's an intermediate function to allow you to define several
areas of the document where images should be replaced. This example script just replaces <code>h3</code>s.</p>

<pre>
function imageReplacement()
{
	replaceThem(document.getElementsByTagName('h3'));
}
</pre>

<p>However, if you'd also like to replace, say, all links in <code>div id="nav"</code>, do</p>

<pre>
function imageReplacement()
{
	replaceThem(document.getElementsByTagName('h3'));
	replaceThem(document.getElementById('nav').getElementsByTagName('a'));
}
</pre>

<h4>Image replacement</h4>

<p>The function <code>replaceThem()</code> handles the actual image replacement. It is handed an array
which it searches for elements with an <code>id</code>. If it finds one, the script replaces the
element's <code>firstChild</code> (the text node containing the text) for an image with a name that's
similar to the <code>id</code>.</p>

<p>To be on the safe side I also set the <code>alt</code> attribute. Theoretically it's unnecessary, since
images will shown only when the browser supports images, but better safe than sorry.</p>

<pre>
function replaceThem(x)
{
	var replace = document.createElement('img');
	for (var i=0;i&lt;x.length;i++)
	{
		if (x[i].id)
		{
			var y = replace.cloneNode(true);
			y.src = 'pix/' + x[i].id + '.gif';
			y.alt = x[i].firstChild.nodeValue;
			x[i].replaceChild(y,x[i].firstChild);
		}
	}
}
</pre>
