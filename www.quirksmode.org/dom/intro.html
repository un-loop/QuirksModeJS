<h2>W3C DOM -Introduction</h2>

<div id="header"></div>

<div class="floater">
<p>See section 8A of <a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/book/">the book</a> for a general introduction; sections 8B through 8E for
detailed treatments of the methods and properties discussed on this page.</p>
<p>The Level 1 DOM is supported by Mozilla, Explorer 5, Konqueror,
Opera 5+ and Ice Browser.</p>
</div>


<p class="intro">The <em>Document Object Model</em> (DOM) is the model that describes how all elements in an HTML page,
like input fields, images, paragraphs etc., are related to the topmost structure: the <code>document</code> itself.
By calling the element by its proper DOM name, we can influence it.</p>

<p>On this page I give an introduction to the W3C Level 1 DOM that has been implemented
in the newest generation of browsers. It will give you an overview of how the DOM works and what
you can do with it.</p>

<p>First some words about the
<a href="#rec" class="page">DOM Recommendation</a> and the purpose of the DOM, then I teach you what
<a href="#nodes" class="page">nodes</a> are and how you can
<a href="#walk" class="page">walk the DOM tree</a> from node to node. Then it's time to learn how to
<a href="#get" class="page">get</a> a specific node and how to
<a href="#change" class="page">change</a> its value or attributes. Finally, I'll teach you how to
<a href="#create" class="page">create nodes</a> yourself, the ultimate purpose of the new DOM.</p>

<h3 id="rec">The Recommendation</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/" class="external">Level 1 DOM Recommendation</a> has been developed by the W3C to provide any programming
language with access to each part of an XML document. As long as you use the methods and properties
that are part of the recommendation, it doesn't matter if you parse an XML document with VBScript, Perl
or JavaScript. In each language you can read out whatever you like and make changes to the XML document
itself.</p>

<p class="smaller">As some of you might have guessed, this paragraph describes an ideal situation and
differences (between browsers, for instance) do exist. Generally, however, they're far smaller than
usual so that learning to use the W3C DOM in JavaScript will help you to learn using it in another
programming language.</p>

<p>In a way HTML pages can be considered as XML documents. Therefore the Level 1 DOM
will work fine on an HTML document, as long as the browser can handle the necessary scripts.</p>

<p>You can read out the text and attributes of every HTML tag in your document, you can delete tags and
their content, you can even create new tags and insert them into the document so that you can really
rewrite your pages on the fly, without a trip back to the server.</p>

<p>Because it is developed to offer access to and change every aspect of XML documents,
the DOM has many possibilities that the average web developer will never need. For
instance, you can use it to edit the comments in your HTML document, but I don't see any reason why
you would want to do so. Similarly, there are sections of the DOM that deal with the DTD/Doctype, with
DocumentFragments (tiny bits of a document) or the enigmatic CDATA. You won't need these parts of
the DOM in your HTML pages, so I ignore them and concentrate instead on the things that you'll need in
your daily work.</p>

<h3 id="nodes">Nodes</h3>

<p>The DOM is a Document Object Model, a model of how the various objects of a document are related to each
other. In the Level 1 DOM, each object, whatever it may be exactly, is a <em>Node</em>. So if you do</p>

<pre>
&lt;P&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/P&gt;
</pre>

<p>you have created two nodes: an <em>element</em> P and a <em>text node</em> with content '<em>This is
a paragraph</em>'. The text node is inside the element, so it is considered a <em>child node</em> of the
element. Conversely, the element is considered the <em>parent node</em> of the text node.</p>

<pre>
              &lt;P&gt; &lt;-- element node
               |
               |
     This is a paragraph &lt;-- text node
</pre>

<p>If you do</p>

<pre>
&lt;P&gt;This is a &lt;B&gt;paragraph&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
</pre>

<p>the element node P has two children, one of which has a child of its own:</p>

<pre>
              &lt;P&gt;
               |
         --------------
        |              |
    This is a         &lt;B&gt;
                       |
                       |
                    paragraph
</pre>

<p>Finally there are <em>attribute nodes</em>. <span class="smaller">(Confusingly, they are not counted as children
of an element node. In fact, while writing this pages I've done a few tests that seem to indicate
that Explorer 5 on Windows doesn't see attributes as nodes at all.)</span> So</p>

<pre>
&lt;P ALIGN="right"&gt;This is a &lt;B&gt;paragraph&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
</pre>

<p>would give something like</p>

<pre>
              &lt;P&gt; ----------------
               |                  |
         --------------         ALIGN
        |              |          |
    This is a         &lt;B&gt;         |
                       |        right
                       |
                    paragraph
</pre>

<p>So these are element nodes, text nodes and attribute nodes. They constitute about 99% of the content of an
HTML page and you'll usually busy yourself with manipulating them. There are more kinds of nodes, but I skip
them for the moment.</p>

<p>As you'll understand, the element node P also has its own parent, this is usually the document, sometimes
another element like a DIV. So the whole HTML document can be seen as a tree consisting of a lot of nodes,
most of them having child nodes (and these, too, can have children).</p>

<pre>
            &lt;BODY&gt;
               |
               |-------------------------------------
               |                                     |
              &lt;P&gt; ----------------            lots more nodes
               |                  |
         --------------         ALIGN
        |              |          |
    This is a         &lt;B&gt;         |
                       |        right
                       |
                    paragraph
</pre>

<h3 id="walk">Walking through the DOM tree</h3>

<p>Knowing the exact structure of the DOM tree, you can walk through it in search of the element
you want to influence. For instance, assume the element node P has been stored in the variable
<code>x</code> (later on I'll explain how you do this). Then if we want to access the BODY we do</p>

<pre>
x.parentNode
</pre>

<p>We take the parent node of x and do something with it. To reach the B node:</p>

<pre>
x.childNodes[1]
</pre>

<p><code>childNodes</code> is an array that contains all children of the node <code>x</code>. Of course
numbering starts at zero, so <code>childNodes[0]</code> is the text node 'This is a' and <code>childNodes[1]</code>
is the element node B.</p>

<p>Two special cases: <code>x.firstChild</code> accesses the first child of x (the text node), while
<code>x.lastChild</code> accesses the last child of x (the element node B).</p>

<p>So supposing the P is the first child of the body, which in turn is the first child of the document,
you can reach the element node B by either of these commands:</p>

<pre>
document.firstChild.firstChild.lastChild;
document.firstChild.childNodes[0].lastChild;
document.firstChild.childNodes[0].childNodes[1];
etc.
</pre>

<p>or even (though it's a bit silly)</p>

<pre>
document.firstChild.childNodes[0].parentNode.firstChild.childNodes[1];
</pre>

<h3 id="get">Getting an element</h3>

<p>However, walking through the document in this way is quite cumbersome. You'll need to be absolutely certain
of the structure of the entire DOM tree and since the whole purpose of the Level 1 DOM is to allow you to modify the
DOM tree, this could lead to problems really quickly.</p>

<p>Therefore there are several ways of jumping directly to an element of your choice. Once you have
arrived there, you can walk the last bit of the DOM tree to where you want to be.</p>

<p>So let's continue with our example. You want to access the element node B. The very simplest way
is to directly jump to it. By the method <code>document.getElementsByTagName</code> you can construct an
array of all tags B in the document and then go to one of them. Let's assume that this B is the
first one in the document, then you can simply do</p>

<pre>
var x = document.getElementsByTagName('B')[0]
</pre>

<p>and <code>x</code> contains the element node B. First you order the browser to get all elements B in
the document (<code>document.getElementsByTagName('B')</code>), then you select the first of all B's in
the document (<code>[0]</code>) and you've arrived where you want to be.</p>

<p>You could also do</p>

<pre>
var x = document.getElementsByTagName('P')[0].lastChild;
</pre>

<p>Now you go to the first paragraph in the document (we assume that our P is the first one) and then
go to its <code>lastChild</code>.</p>

<p>The best way, the only way to be certain that you reach the correct element regardless of the current
structure of the DOM tree, is to give the B an ID:</p>

<pre>
&lt;P ALIGN="right"&gt;This is a &lt;B ID="hereweare"&gt;paragraph&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
</pre>

<p>Now you can simply say</p>

<pre>
var x = document.getElementById('hereweare');
</pre>

<p>and the element node B is stored in <code>x</code>.</p>

<h3 id="change">Changing a node</h3>

<p>Now that we have reached the node, we want to change something. Suppose we want to change the bold
text to '<em>bold bit of text</em>'. We then have to access the correct node and change its
<code>nodeValue</code>. Now the correct node in this case is not the element node B but its child text
node: we want to change the text, not the element. So we simply do</p>

<pre>
document.getElementById('hereweare').firstChild.nodeValue='bold bit of text';
</pre>

<p>and the node changes. <a href="javascript:test('bold bit of text')" class="page">Try it</a> and change
it <a href="javascript:test('paragraph')" class="page">back again</a>.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
<!--
function test(txt) {
	if (document.getElementById && document.createElement)
		document.getElementById('hereweare').firstChild.nodeValue=txt;
	else alert('Your browser doesn\'t support the Level 1 DOM');
}

function test2(val) {
	if (document.getElementById && document.createElement) {
		node = document.getElementById('hereweare').parentNode;
		node.setAttribute('align',val);
	}
	else alert('Your browser doesn\'t support the Level 1 DOM');
}
// -->
</script>

<p align="right">This is a <b id="hereweare">paragraph</b></p>

<p>You can change the <code>nodeValue</code> of each text node or each attribute. Thus you can also change
the ALIGN attribute of the paragraph. <a href="javascript:test2('left')" class="page">Try it</a> and change it
<a href="javascript:test2('right')" class="page">back again</a>.</p>

<p>This, too, is quite simple. Take the node you need (the B's parentNode, in this case), then
use the <code>setAttribute()</code> method to set the ALIGN attribute to the value you want:</p>

<pre>
function test2(val) {
	if (document.getElementById && document.createElement)
	{
		node = document.getElementById('hereweare').parentNode;
		node.setAttribute('align',val);
	}
	else alert('Your browser doesn\'t support the Level 1 DOM');
}
</pre>

<h3 id="create">Creating and removing nodes</h3>

<p>Changing nodes is nice, it can even be useful, but it's nothing compared to actually creating your
own nodes and inserting them into your document. I can easily
<a href="javascript:test3()" class="page">add an HR</a> right below this paragraph and
<a href="javascript:test4()" class="page">remove</a> it quite as easily.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
<!--
function test3() {
	if (document.getElementById && document.createElement) {
		var x = document.createElement('HR');
		document.getElementById('inserthrhere').appendChild(x);
	}
	else alert('Your browser doesn\'t support the Level 1 DOM');
}

function test4() {
	if (document.getElementById && document.createElement) {
		var node = document.getElementById('inserthrhere')
		node.removeChild(node.childNodes[0]);
	}
	else alert('Your browser doesn\'t support the Level 1 DOM');
}
// -->
</script>

<span id="inserthrhere"></span>

<p>Creating the element is done by a special method:</p>

<pre>
var x = document.createElement('HR');
</pre>

<p>Thus an HR is created and temporarily stored in <code>x</code>. The second step is to insert
x into the document. I wrote a special SPAN with ID="inserthrhere" at point where
it should appear. So we use the <code>appendChild()</code> method on the SPAN and the HR is made a
child of the SPAN and it magically appears:</p>

<pre>
document.getElementById('inserthrhere').appendChild(x);
</pre>

<p>Removing it is slightly more complex. First I create a temporary variable <code>node</code> to
store the SPAN, then I tell it to remove its first child (the HR).</p>

<pre>
var node = document.getElementById('inserthrhere')
node.removeChild(node.childNodes[0]);
</pre>

<p>In the same way we can create a new text node and append it to our faithful B ID="hereweare"</p>

<pre>
var x = document.createTextNode(' A new text node has been appended!');
document.getElementById('hereweare').appendChild(x);
</pre>

<script type="text/javascript">
<!--
function test5() {
	if (document.getElementById && document.createElement)
	{
		var x = document.createTextNode(' A new text node has been appended!');
		document.getElementById('hereweare').appendChild(x);
	}
}
// -->
</script>

<p><a href="javascript:test5()" class="page">Try it</a>, then
<a href="#change" class="page">go up</a> to see the result. You
will notice that executing the old functions does not remove the new text node, that's because
it has become a <em>separate node</em>:</p>

<pre>
           &lt;B&gt;
            |
       ------------
      |            |
  paragraph    A new text node
               has been appended!
</pre>

<p class="smaller">(To merge them into one node use the <code>normalize()</code> method that's sadly
not supported by Explorer 5 on Windows).</p>

<p>I won't tell you how to remove the text node, try writing that script yourself. It'll be a useful exercise.</p>
