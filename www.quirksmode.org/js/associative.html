<h2>Objects as associative arrays</h2>

<div id="header"></div>

<div class="floater">
<p>See section 5K of <a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/book/">the book</a>.</p>
<p>This page has been <a href="http://www.misfu.com/static/Javascript/associative.html" class="external">translated into French</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class="intro">On this page I explain how JavaScript objects are also associative arrays (hashes).
Using these you can associate a key string with a value string, which can be very useful sometimes.</p>

<p>Suppose you have a mouseover / click image swap script. You want to keep track of the status of each
image, whether it is normal, mouseovered or clicked. In addition you want to be able to reach this
status by image name. So if you have an image named '<em>Home</em>' you want to read out</p>

<pre>
theStatus.Home
</pre>

<p>and get one of the values '<em>normal</em>', '<em>mouseover</em>' or '<em>clicked</em>', corresponding
to the current status of the image.<br />
To do this you need JavaScript <em>objects</em>.</p>

<h3>Objects in JavaScript</h3>

<p>JavaScript is an <em>object oriented</em> language. However, in
practice objects defined by the programmer himself are rarely used, except in complex DOM API's.
Of course such standard objects as <code>window</code> and <code>document</code> and their
numerous offspring are very important, but they are defined by the browser, not by the programmer.</p>

<p>I myself have written JavaScript for more than three years without ever
defining an object. The technique explained on this page is the first <em>practical</em> use
of programmer-defined objects I've found.</p>

<p>Since the only other programming languages I know are Commodore 64 Basic (which is not
object oriented, to put it mildly) and Perl (which doesn't need to be object oriented)
and since I don't have any formal training in programming I cannot write a general
introduction to objects and object oriented programming. Therefore a quick overview will have
to suffice.</p>

<h3>Methods and properties</h3>

<p>In JavaScript you can define your own objects. In addition, you can assign <em>methods</em> and
<em>properties</em> to each object, pre-written or self-defined.</p>

<ul>
<li>Methods are 'things that do something', they can be recognized by their
brackets <code>()</code>. When you call them, like <code>object.method()</code>, something happens.</li>
<li>Properties are 'things that are something'. They have a value, for instance a number, a
<a href="strings.html">string</a> or a
<a href="boolean.html">Boolean</a> value. When you call them, like
<code>object.property</code>, you get (or set) this value.</li>
</ul>

<p>Normal JavaScript <a href="function.html">functions</a> are also methods (hence the brackets).
If you do</p>

<pre>
document.write('text')
</pre>

<p>you execute the pre-defined <code>write()</code> method
of the document object. If you write your own functions you add methods to the <code>window</code> object,
the parent of all other JavaScript objects.</p>

<p>Likewise, if you ask for the <code>innerHeight</code> of a page, you
access a property of the <code>window</code> object and if you define a variable of your own you really
add a new property to the <code>window</code> object.</p>

<p>So you already use methods and properties in everyday JavaScripting. Since most of these are
preprogrammed functions and variables, you usually don't need to worry about the objects themselves,
they're just a kind of 'black boxes' that contain useful stuff. The methods and properties
(functions and variables) that you define yourself are usually added to the <code>window</code> object.</p>

<h3>Defining an object and properties</h3>

<p>But now we want to create an object of our own. This is simple:</p>

<pre>
var theStatus = new Object;
</pre>

<p>Now we have initialized our <code>theStatus</code> object and we can start adding properties (in this
example we don't need methods). What we want is to create one property for each image on the page.
We could do</p>

<pre>
theStatus.Home = 'normal';
</pre>

<p>Now we have added a new property <code>Home</code> to our object and set its value to the string
<em>'normal'</em>. (Remember that JavaScript is case sensitive, so the property <code>home</code> does
not exist, only <code>Home</code>.)</p>

<p>All this is very useful, but using this notation we encounter problems later on. Suppose we want
to create a property of <code>theStatus</code> for each image on the page.
The property should have the same name as the image and its value should be 'normal'.</p>

<p>We cannot do:</p>

<pre class="wrong">
var x = document.images;
for (var i=0;i&lt;x.length;i++)
{
	var theName = x[i].name;
	theStatus.theName = 'normal';
}
</pre>

<p>We go through the entire images array of the page, take the name of each image and then try to
create a new property with the same name. But the code above doesn't work. Each time you do</p>

<pre class="wrong">
	theStatus.theName = 'normal';
</pre>

<p>JavaScript faithfully creates a new property named <code>theName</code> and sets its value to
<em>'normal'</em>. After executing this script you have only one property <code>theName</code>.
This is not what we want, we want one property for each image.</p>

<h3>Associative arrays</h3>

<p>So we have to use one of JavaScript's minor mysteries.
In JavaScript, objects are also associative arrays (or hashes). That is, the property</p>

<pre>
theStatus.Home
</pre>

<p>can also be read or written by calling</p>

<pre>
theStatus['Home']
</pre>

<p>Thus, you can access each property by entering the name of the property <em>as a string</em>
into this array. Such an array associates each <em>key</em> with a <em>value</em> (in this
case the key <em>Home</em> is associated with the value <em>normal</em>).
In the Perl programming language it is also called a <em>hash</em>.</p>

<p>Unlike Perl, which requires you to create such an associative array explicitly,
JavaScript automatically creates a associative array for each object.</p>

<p>You see this behaviour with common objects like a form. You can access a form by performing either
of these DOM calls:</p>

<pre>
document.forms['theForm']
document.forms.theForm
</pre>

<p class="smaller">(You can also use <code>document.theForm</code> but that's a special case, not
regular behaviour of JavaScript objects/associative arrays).</p>

<p>So when we want to set the status of each image to 'normal' in our object, we do</p>

<pre>
var x = document.images;
for (var i=0;i&lt;x.length;i++)
{
  var theName = x[i].name;
  theStatus[theName] = 'normal';
}
</pre>

<p>and it works. Now <code>theName</code> (a string) is put into the brackets <code>[]</code> where a
string is expected. So you create a new key/value pair, which is the same as a new property with
a value.</p>

<p>All this is JavaScript magic at its fullest. I don't completely understand what I'm doing either,
but it works just fine. Basically you now have the power to let one name or string refer to another
one.</p>

<h3>for (var i in object)</h3>

<p class='smaller'><code>for (var i in object)</code> is equivalent to Perl <code>foreach $key (keys %hash)</code>.</p>

<p>Just as you can go through each element of a normal array by</p>

<pre>
var x = [the array];
for (var i = 0;i&lt;x.length;i++)
{
  do something with x[i]
}
</pre>

<p>you can also go through each element of an associative array. Suppose you want to go through the status values
of all images. If the status of the image is '<em>mouseover</em>' you want to call a function
<code>callFn()</code> and pass the image name to it. You can of course tediously write out everything:</p>

<pre>
if (theStatus.Home == 'mouseover')
   callFn('Home'):
if (theStatus.Place == 'mouseover')
   callFn('Place'):
etc.
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>
if (theStatus['Home'] == 'mouseover')
   callFn('Home'):
if (theStatus['Place'] == 'mouseover')
   callFn('Place'):
etc.
</pre>

<p>But this quickly leads to immense scripts. Besides, if you rename an image later on you also have to
change a line of code and of course you forget, so you get errors etc.</p>

<p>Fortunately JavaScript has the <code>for/in</code> statement which is meant exactly for this situation. If you
do</p>

<pre>
for (var i in theStatus)
{
  if (theStatus[i] == 'mouseover')
    callFn(i)
}
</pre>

<p>you go through all properties of the <code>theStatus</code> object (= all keys in the associative array
<code>theStatus</code>). The variable <code>i</code> succesively becomes the name of each property
of the object (key of the associative array) so you can do something with <code>theStatus[i]</code> and it is
done to each property.<br />
In this case, if an image status has the value '<em>mouseover</em>' you call <code>callFn()</code> and pass
it the key (the name of the image).</p>

<p class="smaller">(Note that JavaScript doesn't guarantee any particular <em>order</em> for
the properties. So you cannot expect the property that was defined first to appear first,
it might come last.)</p>

<h3>Test script</h3>

<p>A tiny script for your testing pleasure.
If you click <a href="javascript:testIt()">this link</a> this script is executed:</p>

<pre>
var theStatus = new Object();

function testIt() {
	theStatus.Home = 'mouseover';
	theStatus['Place'] = 'click';
	for (var i in theStatus)
	{
		alert('theStatus[\''+i+'\'] is ' + theStatus[i])
	}
}
</pre>
