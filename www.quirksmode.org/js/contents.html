<h2>JavaScript - Table of contents</h2>

<div id="header"></div>

<p class="intro">The JavaScript part of my site contains all JavaScript pages.
It is by far the largest section of my site.</p>

<p>I have created seven JavaScript categories that follow <a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/book/">my book</a>'s subdivision:
General (chapters 1-4), Core (5), BOM (6), Events (7), DOM (8), CSS modification (9), and Data Retrieval (10).</p>


<p><a href="#general" class="page">General</a> |
<a href="#core" class="page">Core</a> |
<a href="#bom" class="page" title="Browser Object Model">BOM</a> |
<a href="#events" class="page">Events</a> |
<a href="#dom" class="page" title="Document Object Model">DOM</a>  |
<a href="#css" class="page">CSS modification</a> |
<a href="#data" class="page">Data retrieval</a></p>
