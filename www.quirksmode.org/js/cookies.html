<p class="intro">On this page I give three functions to save, read and erase cookies. Using these
functions you can manage cookies on your site.</p>

<p>First an <a href="#intro" class="page">introduction</a> to cookies, and a summary of
<a href="#doccookie" class="page">document.cookie</a>, followed by an
<a href="#ex" class="page">example</a>. Then come the
<a href="#script" class="page">three functions</a> and their
<a href="#expl" class="page">explanation</a>.</p>

<h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>

<p>Cookies were originally invented by Netscape to give 'memory' to web servers and browsers. The HTTP
protocol, which arranges for the transfer of web pages to your browser and browser requests for
pages to servers, is <em>state-less</em>, which means that once the server has sent a page to a browser
requesting it, it doesn't remember a thing about it. So if you come to the same web page a
second, third, hundredth or millionth time, the server once again considers it the very first time you ever came there.</p>

<p>This can be annoying in a number of ways. The server cannot remember if you identified
yourself when you want to access protected pages, it cannot remember your user preferences, it
cannot remember anything. As soon as personalization was invented, this became a major problem.</p>

<p>Cookies were invented to solve this problem. There are other ways to solve it, but cookies are
easy to maintain and very versatile.</p>

<h3>How cookies work</h3>

<p>A cookie is nothing but a small text file that's stored in your browser. It contains some data:</p>

<ol>
<li>A name-value pair containing the actual data</li>
<li>An expiry date after which it is no longer valid</li>
<li>The domain and path of the server it should be sent to</li>
</ol>

<p>As soon as you request a page from a server to which a cookie should be sent, the cookie
is added to the HTTP header. Server side programs can then read out the information
and decide that you have the right to view the page you requested or that you want your links
to be yellow on a green background.</p>

<p>So every time you visit the site the cookie comes from, information about you is available.
This is very nice sometimes, at other times it may somewhat endanger your privacy. Fortunately
more and more browsers give you the opportunity to manage your cookies (deleting the one
from the big ad site, for example).</p>

<p>Cookies can be read by JavaScript too. They're mostly used for storing user preferences.</p>

<h4>name-value</h4>

<p>Each cookie has a <em>name-value pair</em> that contains the actual information. The name
of the cookie is for your benefit, you will search for this name when reading out the cookie
information.</p>

<p>If you want to read out the cookie you search for the name and see what value is attached to it.
Read out this value. Of course you yourself have to decide which value(s) the cookie can have and
to write the scripts to deal with these value(s).</p>

<h4>Expiry date</h4>

<p>Each cookie has an <em>expiry date</em> after which it is trashed. If you don't specify
the expiry date the cookie is trashed when you close the browser. This expiry date should
be in UTC (Greenwich) time.</p>

<h4>Domain and path</h4>

<p>Each cookie also has a <em>domain</em> and a <em>path</em>. The domain tells the browser
to which domain the cookie should be sent. If you don't specify it, it becomes the domain of
the page that sets the cookie, in the case of this page <em>www.quirksmode.org</em>.<br />
Please note that the purpose of the domain is to allow cookies to cross sub-domains. My cookie
will not be read by search.quirksmode.org because its domain is www.quirksmode.org . When I set the
domain to quirksmode.org, the search sub-domain may also read the cookie.<br />
I cannot set the cookie domain to a domain I'm not in, I cannot make the domain www.microsoft.com .
Only quirksmode.org is allowed, in this case.</p>

<p>The <em>path</em> gives you the chance to specify a directory where the cookie is active.
So if you want the cookie to be only sent to pages in the directory cgi-bin, set the
path to <code>/cgi-bin</code>. Usually the path is set to <code>/</code>, which means the cookie is
valid throughout the entire domain.<br />
This script does so, so the cookies you can set on this page will be sent to any page in the
<em>www.quirksmode.org</em> domain (though only this page has a script that searches for the
cookies and does something with them).</p>


<h3 id="doccookie">document.cookie</h3>

<p>Cookies can be created, read and erased by JavaScript. They are accessible through the
property <code>document.cookie</code>. Though you can treat document.cookie as if it's a
<a href="strings.html">string</a>, it isn't really, and you have only access to
the <em>name-value</em> pairs.</p>

<p>If I want to set a cookie for this domain with a
name-value pair 'ppkcookie1=testcookie' that expires in seven days from the moment I
write this sentence, I do</p>

<pre>
document.cookie =
  'ppkcookie1=testcookie; expires=Thu, 2 Aug 2001 20:47:11 UTC; path=/'
</pre>

<ol>
<li>First the name-value pair ('<code>ppkcookie1=testcookie</code>')</li>
<li>then a semicolon and a space</li>
<li>then the expiry date in the correct format ('<code>expires=Thu, 2 Aug 2001 20:47:11 UTC</code>')</li>
<li>again a semicolon and a space</li>
<li>then the path (<code>path=/</code>)</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a very strict syntax, don't change it!
<span class="smallink">(Of course the script manages these dirty bits for you)</span></p>

<p>Also, even though it looks like I'm writing this whole string to the string document.cookie,
as soon as I read it out again I only see the name-value pair:</p>

<pre>
ppkcookie1=testcookie
</pre>

<p>If I want to set another cookie, I again do</p>

<pre>
document.cookie =
  'ppkcookie2=another test; expires=Fri, 3 Aug 2001 20:47:11 UTC; path=/'
</pre>

<p>The first cookie is not overwritten, as it would when <code>document.cookie</code> would be
a real string. Instead the second one is added to <code>document.cookie</code>, so if we read it out we get</p>

<pre>
ppkcookie1=testcookie; ppkcookie2=another test
</pre>

<p>If I reset a cookie</p>

<pre>
document.cookie =
  'ppkcookie2=yet another test; expires=Fri, 3 Aug 2001 20:47:11 UTC; path=/'
</pre>

<p>the old cookie is overwritten and document.cookie reads</p>

<pre>
ppkcookie1=testcookie; ppkcookie2=yet another test
</pre>

<p>To read out a cookie you have to treat document.cookie as a
<a href="strings.html">string</a> and search for certain characters
(semicolons, for instance) and for the cookie name. I'll explain how to do it below.</p>

<p>Finally, to remove a cookie, set it with an expiry date before today. The browser sees
that the cookie has expired and removes it.</p>

<pre>
document.cookie =
  'ppkcookie2=yet another test; expires=Fri, 27 Jul 2001 02:47:11 UTC; path=/'
</pre>

<h3 id="ex">Example</h3>

<p>If you're thoroughly confused by all this strange syntax, try the example below. You
can set two cookies, ppkcookie1 and ppkcookie2. Fill in the desired value in the text box.</p>

<form name="cookieform" action="#"><p>
The value of the cookie should be <input name="cookievalue" />
</p></form>

<p><a href="javascript:saveIt('ppkcookie1')" class="page">Create cookie 1</a><br />
<a href="javascript:readIt('ppkcookie1')" class="page">Read cookie 1</a><br />
<a href="javascript:eraseIt('ppkcookie1')" class="page">Erase cookie 1</a>.</p>

<p><a href="javascript:saveIt('ppkcookie2')" class="page">Create cookie 2</a><br />
<a href="javascript:readIt('ppkcookie2')" class="page">Read cookie 2</a><br />
<a href="javascript:eraseIt('ppkcookie2')" class="page">Erase cookie 2</a>.</p>

<p>For comparision, read out
<a class="page" href="javascript:alert('document.cookie is now\n' + document.cookie);">document.cookie</a>.</p>

<p>I set the cookies to remain active for seven days. If you return to this page within
that time, you'll get an alert that the cookie(s) is/are still active. Try it by setting
a cookie, then reloading this page.</p>

<h3 id="script">The scripts</h3>

<p>These are the three scripts you need.</p>

<pre>
function createCookie(name,value,days) {
	if (days) {
		var date = new Date();
		date.setTime(date.getTime()+(days*24*60*60*1000));
		var expires = "; expires="+date.toGMTString();
	}
	else var expires = "";
	document.cookie = name+"="+value+expires+"; path=/";
}

function readCookie(name) {
	var nameEQ = name + "=";
	var ca = document.cookie.split(';');
	for(var i=0;i &lt; ca.length;i++) {
		var c = ca[i];
		while (c.charAt(0)==' ') c = c.substring(1,c.length);
		if (c.indexOf(nameEQ) == 0) return c.substring(nameEQ.length,c.length);
	}
	return null;
}

function eraseCookie(name) {
	createCookie(name,"",-1);
}
</pre>

<h3 id="expl">Explanation</h3>

<p>The functions are not very difficult, the hardest part is creating the correct syntax
for setting a cookie.</p>

<h4>createCookie</h4>

<p>When calling <code>createCookie()</code> you have to give it three bits of information: the
name and value of the cookie and the number of days it is to remain active. In this case
the name-value pair should become <code>ppkcookie=testcookie</code> and it should be active
for 7 days.</p>

<pre>
createCookie('ppkcookie','testcookie',7)
</pre>

<p>If you set the number of days to <code>0</code> the cookie is trashed when the user closes
the browser. If you set the days to a <em>negative</em> number the cookie is trashed
immediately.</p>

<p>The function receives the arguments and starts doing its job.</p>

<pre>
function createCookie(name,value,days) {
</pre>

<p>First of all see if there is a <code>days</code> value. If there isn't we don't need to
do the time calculation.</p>

<pre>
	if (days) {
</pre>

<p>If there is, create a new
<a href="introdate.html#date">Date object</a> containing the current date.</p>

<pre>
		var date = new Date();
</pre>

<p>Now get the current Time (in milliseconds) and add the required number of days (in
milliseconds). Set the Time of the date to this new value, so that it now contains the
date in milliseconds that the cookie should expire.</p>

<pre>
		date.setTime(date.getTime()+(days*24*60*60*1000));
</pre>

<p>Set the variable <code>expires</code> to this date in the UTC/GMT format required by
cookies.</p>

<pre>
		var expires = "; expires="+date.toGMTString();
	}
</pre>

<p>If <code>0</code> is passed to the function, <code>expires</code> is not set and the cookie expires
when the user closes his browser..</p>

<pre>
	else var expires = "";
</pre>

<p>Finally write the new cookie into <code>document.cookie</code> in the correct syntax.</p>

<pre>
	document.cookie = name+"="+value+expires+"; path=/";
}
</pre>

<p>Cookie created.</p>

<h4>readCookie</h4>

<p>To read out a cookie, call this function and pass the name of the cookie. Put the
name in a variable. First check if this variable has a value (if the cookie does not exist
the variable becomes <code>null</code>, which might upset the rest of your function),
then do whatever is necessary.</p>

<pre>
var x = readCookie('ppkcookie1')
if (x) {
	[do something with x]
}
</pre>

<p>The function receives the argument and starts.</p>

<pre>
function readCookie(name) {
</pre>

<p>We're going to search for the name of the cookie, followed by an <code>=</code>. So
create this new string and put it in <code>nameEQ</code>:</p>

<pre>
	var nameEQ = name + "=";
</pre>

<p>Then split document.cookie on semicolons. <code>ca</code> becomes an array containing
all cookies that are set for this domain and path.</p>

<pre>
	var ca = document.cookie.split(';');
</pre>

<p>Then we go through the array (so through all cookies):</p>

<pre>
	for(var i=0;i &lt; ca.length;i++) {
</pre>

<p>Set <code>c</code> to the cookie to be checked.</p>

<pre>
		var c = ca[i];
</pre>

<p>If the first character is a space, remove it by using the
<a href="strings.html#substring">substring()</a> method.
Continue doing this until the first character is not a space.</p>

<pre>
		while (c.charAt(0)==' ') c = c.substring(1,c.length);
</pre>

<p>Now string <code>c</code> begins with the name of the current cookie. If this is the
name of the desired cookie</p>

<pre>
		if (c.indexOf(nameEQ) == 0)
</pre>

<p>we've found what we were looking for. We now only need to
return the value of the cookie, which is the part of <code>c</code> that comes after
<code>nameEQ</code>. By returning this value we also end the function: mission accomplished.</p>

<pre>
		if (c.indexOf(nameEQ) == 0) return c.substring(nameEQ.length,c.length);
	}
</pre>

<p>If, after having gone through all cookies, we haven't found the name we're looking for,
the cookie is not present. We return <code>null</code>.</p>

<pre>
	return null;
}
</pre>

<p>Cookie read.</p>
<h4>eraseCookie</h4>

<p>Erasing is extremely simple.</p>

<pre>
eraseCookie('ppkcookie')
</pre>

<p>Pass the name of the cookie to be erased</p>

<pre>
function eraseCookie(name) {
</pre>

<p>and call <code>createCookie()</code> to set the cookie with an expiry date of one day ago.</p>

<pre>
	createCookie(name,"",-1);
}
</pre>

<p>The browser, seeing that the expiry date has passed, immediately removes the cookie.</p>
