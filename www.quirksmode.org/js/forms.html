<h2>Introduction to Forms</h2>

<div id="header"></div>

<div class="floater">
<p>See section 8J of <a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/book/">the book</a>. However, this page contains a more complete overview
of how to write a basic form validation script.</p>
</div>

<p class="intro">On this page I give the code you need for checking user input in a form.
Using these bits of code, you can write your own scripts to validate forms</p>

<p>I can't give you a complete script, because each form and each check are different.
You'll have to use the elements I explain on this page to build your own script.
I created an <a href="formex.html">example form and script</a> that you can study to
get the hang of it.</p>

<p>On this page I discuss the
<a class="page" href="#limits">limitations</a> of using JavaScript to check a form, then I'll explain the
<a class="page" href="#onsubmit">onsubmit event handler</a>, followed by the few
<a class="page" href="#methods">methods and properties</a> of the form itself.
Then it's time for
<a class="page" href="#access">accessing the form elements</a> and the specific syntax for accessing
the user defined
<a class="page" href="#value">value</a> of form elements.</p>

<p class="smaller">See also Jeff Howden's excellent article
<a href="http://www.evolt.org/article/rating/17/28553/index.html"
	class="external" >Forms & JavaScript Living Together in Harmony</a>
for some of the most common usability errors and their solutions.</p>

<h3 id="limits">Limitations</h3>

<p>First of all, you should have a clear idea of what happens when a user submits a
form that has a JavaScript validation script:</p>

<ol>
<li>The form is checked by a JavaScript like the one described below.
If the script finds a mistake the submission is halted here. The user sees an alert
and is asked to re-enter some data.</li>
<li>If nothing is wrong&#8212;or if JavaScript is disabled&#8212;the form is sent to the server and is processed by a CGI
script.</li>
<li>If the CGI script finds a mistake it generates some HTML with an error message
and sends it back to the user. In this case the user has to go back to the form,
re-enter some values and again submit it.</li>
<li>If no mistakes are found, the CGI script does whatever it has to do with the data
and directs the user to a Thank You page.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you see, the form is checked for mistakes <em>twice</em>: by the JavaScript
and by the CGI script. The CGI check always works, since CGI is server side. The
JavaScript check only works when the user has JavaScript enabled.
It follows that the CGI check is the most reliable: it always works regardless of
what browser is used. Then why use a JavaScript check too?</p>

<p>The JavaScript check is very useful <em>in addition to</em> the CGI check because it
can catch mistakes before the form is actually sent to the server. Thus the user doesn't have to
use his <em>back</em> button to return to the form, something that may cause confusion, and then
search for the incorrect form field, which may cause even more confusion.
Therefore the JavaScript check is more user friendly than the CGI check.</p>

<p>In addition, when you use JavaScript the
server doesn't need to spend quite so much time in error handling and is thus a little
quicker. This only matters if you have lots and lots of forms, but it's good to
keep it in mind.</p>

<p>So JavaScript is <em>not</em> a fail-safe method of catching mistakes, but it is very
useful as an addition to CGI checks since it lightens the load on the server and is
more user friendly.
Therefore I recommend using <em>both</em> JavaScript form checks <em>and</em> CGI form checks. This
way, you get both user friendliness and security.</p>

<h3 id="onsubmit">onsubmit</h3>

<p>When using JavaScript to check a form, the first thing you need is the <code>onsubmit</code> event handler.
This event handler specifies a script that is executed when the user submits the form. That script is where
you check whether certain fields have a value, whether the user has checked at least one checkbox,
and any other checks you deem necessary.</p>

<p>The general syntax is:</p>

<pre>
&lt;form action="something.pl" onsubmit="return checkscript()">
</pre>

<p>where <code>checkscript()</code> is the name of the script. This script should return either <code>true</code>
or <code>false</code>. If <code>false</code> is returned, the form will not be submitted. If either <code>true</code>
or <code>false</code> is returned the script stops.</p>

<p>So the general script becomes something like:</p>

<pre>
function checkscript() {
	if (some value is/is not something) {
		// something is wrong
		alert('alert user of problem');
		<b>return false</b>;
	}
	else if (another value is/is not something) {
		// something else is wrong
		alert('alert user of problem');
		<b>return false</b>;
	}

	// If the script makes it to here, everything is OK,
	// so you can submit the form

	<b>return true</b>;
}
</pre>

<p>Of course this function can become much more complex if you have to check a complicated
form with a lot of radio buttons and things. The general idea remains the same, however: You
go through the elements, check whatever you want to check and as soon as you find any mistake, you <code>return false</code>, after
which the script stops and the form is not submitted.</p>

<p>Once you've found a mistake, you should notify the user of the problem. This used to be done by an <code>alert</code>,
but nowadays you can <a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/dom/error.html">generate error messages</a> and insert them next to the form field.</p>


<p>Only at the very end of the script, when you have checked all elements and encountered no mistakes,
you <code>return true</code>, after which the form is submitted.</p>


<h3 id="methods">Form methods and properties</h3>

<p>JavaScript has a few built-in methods and properties for dealing with forms. Three of them
are especially important:</p>

<p>You can submit a form by using the <code>submit()</code> method. To submit the first form on
the page, do</p>

<pre>
document.forms[0].submit()
</pre>

<p>Please note that when a form is submitted by JavaScript <b>the <code>onsubmit</code> event handler
is never executed</b>.<br />
To reset the form, do</p>

<pre>
document.forms[0].reset()
</pre>

<p>I assume, but have not tested, that the <code>onreset</code> event handler isn&#8217;t executed
either if you reset the form through JavaScript.</p>

<p>Finally, you can change the ACTION of a form if you want to:</p>

<pre>
document.forms[0].action = 'the_other_script.pl';
</pre>

<p>This can come in very handily if a form has to be submitted to another script in some
cases.</p>

<h3 id="access">Accessing the form elements</h3>

<p>The form validation script needs to access the form in the HTML page to determine
what values the user has filled in. So first we have to enter the form by means of the
<a href="dom0.html">Level 0 DOM</a>.
The general syntax for accessing a form element is:</p>

<pre>
document.forms[number].elements[number]
</pre>

<p>When the page is loaded, JavaScript makes an array <code>forms</code> in which it
puts all the forms that are on the page. The first form is <code>forms[0]</code>, the
second is <code>forms[1]</code> etc.</p>

<p>Each form has another array in which JavaScript puts all the elements in the form.
The first elements is <code>elements[0]</code>, the second <code>elements[1]</code> etc.
Every <code>&lt;input&gt;, &lt;select&gt; and &lt;textarea&gt;</code> is an element.</p>

<p>In some cases, it's better to use the names of the forms and elements. In HTML, you have
to give a <code>name</code> to each form and each element, like:</p>

<pre>
&lt;form name="personal" action="something.pl" onsubmit="return checkscript()"&gt;
&lt;input type=text size=20 name=name&gt;
&lt;input type=text size=20 name=address&gt;
&lt;input type=text size=20 name=city&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>

<p>Now you can access these elements by:</p>

<pre>
document.personal.name
document.personal.address
document.personal.city
</pre>

<p>The advantage of using names is that you can put all elements somewhere else in the page
and still have a working script, while a script using numbers will have to be changed.
After all, the input box <em>city</em> is <code>document.forms[0].elements[2]</code> in
the example above, but when you suddenly put it at the top of the form, it becomes
<code>document.forms[0].elements[0]</code> and you have to change the script.</p>

<h3 id="value">Determining values</h3>

<p>Of course, the most important thing is to find out what the user has filled in
or checked in the form. At other times you might want to fill in something in the
form.</p>

<p>Below are snippets of scripts that help you access form elements. All of them are meant to
send the user input to the variable <code>user_input</code>. After you've done that, you can check
this value for whatever you want.</p>

<ul>
<li><a class="page" href="#stext">Texts, textareas and hidden fields</a></li>
<li><a class="page" href="#sselect">Select boxes</a></li>
<li><a class="page" href="#scheckbox">Checkboxes</a></li>
<li><a class="page" href="#sradio">Radio buttons</a></li>
</ul>

<p class="smaller">If you'd like to study a practical example, see the <a href="formex.html">example form and script</a>.</p>


<h4 id="stext">Texts, textareas and hidden fields</h4>

<p>Very simple:</p>

<pre>
user_input = document.forms[0].text.value
</pre>

<p>where <code>text</code> is the name of the text field, textarea or hidden field.
The <code>value</code> of this element gives the text, so we transfer it to <code>user_input</code>.</p>

<p>Writing is also possible:</p>

<pre>
document.forms[0].text.value = 'The new value';
</pre>

<h4 id="sselect">Select boxes</h4>

<p>Select boxes are simple too:</p>

<pre>
user_input = document.forms[0].select.value;
</pre>

<p>To change the selected option in a select box, you have to change its <code>selectedIndex</code>, like</p>

<pre>
document.forms[0].select.selectedIndex = 2;
</pre>

<p>Now the third option in the box is selected.</p>

<h5>Old browsers</h5>

<p>In old browsers, select boxes didn't yet have a <code>value</code> property. Back then, this was the
way to find the value of a select box:</p>

<pre>
var selectBox = document.forms[0].select;
user_input = selectBox.options[selectBox.selectedIndex].value
</pre>

<p>First, we need to find out which option the user has selected. <code>document.forms[0].select.selectedIndex</code>
gives us the number of the selected option. JavaScript has created an array <code>options</code> which
contains all options of the select box. So we ask for the selected option in this array and take the <code>value</code>
of it, which we transfer to <code>user_input</code>.</p>

<h4 id="scheckbox">Checkboxes</h4>

<p>Checkboxes need a slightly different approach. We already know their values, but want to
know whether the user has checked them. The <code>checked</code> property tells us. It can have
two values: <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>Now we do:</p>

<pre>
if (document.forms[0].checkbox.checked) {
	user_input = document.forms[0].checkbox.name
}
</pre>

<p>in which <code>checkbox</code> is the name of the checkbox.
If the checkbox is <code>checked</code>, we take its <code>name</code>
(or its <code>value</code>, if you need that bit of data)
and transfer it to <code>user_input</code>.</p>

<p>To check a checkbox, set its property <code>checked</code> to <code>true</code>:</p>

<pre>
document.forms[0].checkbox.checked = true
</pre>

<h4 id="sradio">Radio buttons</h4>

<p>Unfortunately it's not possible to see at once which radio button in a group the user
has checked. You need to go through all radio's and see which one's <code>checked</code>
property is true.</p>

<pre>
for (i=0;i&lt;document.forms[0].radios.length;i++) {
	if (document.forms[0].radios[i].checked) {
		user_input = document.forms[0].radios[i].value;
	}
}
</pre>

<p>where <code>radios</code> is the name of the group of radio buttons.</p>

<p>Note that <code>document.forms[0].radios</code> is an <em>array</em> filled with
all radio buttons. Loop through all of them and see if it is <code>checked</code>.
If one is, transfer the <code>value</code> of that radio button to <code>user_input</code>.</p>

<code>document.forms[0].radios.length</code> gives the number of radio buttons. For each radio
button, we see if it is

<p>To check a radio button, set its property <code>checked</code> to <code>true</code>:</p>

<pre>
document.forms[0].radios[i].checked = true;
</pre>
