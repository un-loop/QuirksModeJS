Nearly everyscript you'll writeuses one or more functions. Therefore it is important thatyou understand what a function is and how it works.</p><p>First I explain the <a class="page" href="#basic">basic syntax</a>, of a function, then I explainhow to <a class="page" href="#calling">call</a> it. After that you learn how to pass<a class="page" href="#arguments">arguments</a> and why you should do this. Finally, we makethe function <a class="page" href="#return">return</a> something.</p><h3 id="basic">The function</h3><p>This is a function:</p><pre>function example(a,b) {	number += a;	alert('You have chosen: ' + b);}</pre><p>It is called like this:</p><pre>example(1,'house')</pre><p>In fact, when you define the function <code>example</code> you create a new JavaScript commandthat you can call from anywhere on the page. Whenever you call it, the JavaScript insidethe curly brackets <code>{}</code> is executed.</p><h3 id="calling">Calling the function</h3><p>You can call the function from any other JavaScript. After the function is executed, the otherscript that called it goes on from the call.</p><pre>alert('Example 1: the House');example(1,'house');(do more stuff)</pre><p>So this script first generates an<a class="page" href="javascript:alert('This is an alert box.')">alert box</a>, then calls thefunction and after the function is finished it continues to do the rest of the instructionsin the calling code.</p><h3 id="arguments">Arguments</h3><p>You can pass <em>arguments</em> to a function. These are variables, either numbers orstrings, with which the function is supposed to do something. Of course the output of thefunction depends on the arguments you give it.</p><p>In the example we pass two arguments, the number <code>1</code> and the string'<code>house</code>':</p><pre>example(1,'house');</pre><p>When these arguments arrive at the function, they are stored in two variables,<code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. You have to declare this in the function header, as youcan see below.</p><pre>function example(a,b)</pre><p>Now the function starts working and does something with a and b:</p><pre>function example(a,b) {	number += a;	alert('You have chosen: ' + b);}</pre><p>It adds 1 to <code>number</code> and alerts: <em>You have chosen: house</em>. Of course,if you call the function like</p><pre>example(5,'palace');</pre><p>it adds 5 to <code>number</code> and alerts <em>You have chosen: palace</em>. The outputof the function depends on the arguments you give it.</p><h4>Using more arguments</h4><p>You can use as many arguments as you like:</p><pre>function example(a,b,c,data,data2) {	number += a;	alert('You have chosen: ' + b);	(do lots more with c, data and data2)}</pre><p>If you forget to pass one argument the function complains. Supposeyou do</p><pre>example(1,'house',16,'more stuff')</pre><p>then 1 is passed to <code>a</code>, 'house' is passed to <code>b</code>, 16 is passed to<code>c</code> and 'more stuff' is passed to <code>data</code>. But now there is nothingfor <code>data2</code> since you did not pass anything to it in the function call. Whenthe function arrives at the part it is supposed to do something with <code>data2</code>,it finds that <code>data2</code> does not exist and gives error messages.</p><p>So always be careful to pass enough arguments. Personally I always try to write functions that need as little argumentsas possible. This keeps my code clean and makes updating easy.</p><h4>Using no arguments</h4><p>You can also write a function without any arguments:</p><pre>function example() {	number += 1;	alert('You have chosen: house');}</pre><p>Of course the function does exactly the same whenever you call it. If youtry to give it arguments, it ignores them since they are not defined in the functionheader.</p><h3 id="return">Returning a value</h3><p>One more thing a function can do is return a value. Suppose we have the followingfunction:</p><pre>function calculate(a,b,c) {	d = (a+b) * c;	return d;}</pre><p>This function calculates a number from the numbers you pass to it. When it's doneit <em>returns</em> the result of the calculation. This is in fact the opposite ofpassing arguments: the function now passes the result back to its calling handle. After any <code>return</code>the function stops working: it doesn't execute any more lines, if there are any.</p><p>In practice this works as follows:</p><pre>var x = calculate(4,5,9);var y = calculate((x/3),3,5);</pre><p>Now you declare a variable <code>x</code> and tell JavaScript to execute <code>calculate()</code>with the arguments 4, 5 and 9 and to put the returned value (81) in <code>x</code>. Then you declarea variable <code>y</code> and execute <code>calculate()</code> again. The first argument is <code>x/3</code>,which means 81/3 = 27, so y becomes 150.</p><p>Of course you can also return strings or even <a href="boolean.html">Boolean</a> values (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>). Whenusing <a href="forms.html">JavaScript in forms</a>, you write a functionthat returns either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> and thus tells the browser whether to submita form or not.</p><h4>Returning to stop the function</h4><p>Sometimes it's useful to add a <code>return</code> to your script to stop the script.If you use <a href="support.html">object detection</a> and you find out the browser can't handlea certain script, use a <code>return</code> to end the function before the browser reaches the dangerous lines itcan't handle.</p><p>Suppose you write a nice <a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/dom/intro.html">W3C DOM</a> script. The first thing you'd have to do is seeingif the browser supports the W3C DOM:</p><pre>function initPage() {	var supported = document.createElement && document.getElementsByTagName;	if (!supported) return;	// start of DOM script	var x = document.getElementById('writeroot');	// etc.}</pre><p>If <code>supported</code> is false (browser doesn't support the W3C DOM), the function stops(it would only lead to error messages in this browser). You do this by using <code>return</code>.Only if the browser supports the W3C DOM it makes it to the next line where the actual DOM script starts.</p><div id="footer"><a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/home.html">Home</a> <a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/sitemap.html">Sitemap</a><p id="validation" class="smaller">Valid XHTML 1.0</p></div></body>
