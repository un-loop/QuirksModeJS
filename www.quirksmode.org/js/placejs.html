<h2>Placing JavaScript in your pages</h2>


<div id="header"></div>

<div class="floater">
<p>See section 4D of <a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/book/">the book</a>. The <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tag is treated
in section 2F.</p>
<p>JavaScript includes are not supported by Netscape 2 and Explorer 3.</p>
<p><code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> is not supported by Netscape 2.</p>

and <a href="http://wiki.ceviz.net/index.php/Quirksmode.org/Javascript_YerleÅŸimi"class="external">Turkish</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class="intro">You need to properly place a JavaScript in an HTML page to make sure the browser executes
it. It isn't particularly difficult, but you do have to separate behavior (JavaScript) and structure (XHTML).</p>

<p>Although there are two ways of doing this, using <a href="#include" class="page">JavaScript includes</a>
is the best way because that makes sure your JavaScript code will reside outside your HTML file. This makes
your pages easier to maintain, since they contain only XHTML. It also allows you to modify the behaviour of
your entire site by editing one single file.</p>

<p>You can also put a JavaScript <a href="#direct" class="page">directly</a> in
your page, but this method is deprecated.
We'll also take a short look at the <a href="#noscript" class="page">&lt;noscript&gt;</a> tag.</p>

<a name="include"></a>
<h3>JavaScript Includes</h3>

<div class="floater">
<p>JavaScript includes are not supported by Netscape 2 and Explorer 3.</p>
<p>Included JavaScript files may not be refreshed in some browsers, no matter how often you hit <em>Reload</em>.
Solution: enter the URL of the .js file in the location bar, load it, hit <em>Reload</em>, go back to the HTML page and reload it.</p>
</div>

<p>You should <em>include</em> a JavaScript file in your pages. This has
several advantages:</p>

<ol><li>By updating one file, you update your script on all pages.</li>
<li>The pages themselves become slightly lighter, because the include file is
cached by the browser, so it doesn't have to be reloaded every time the user
loads a new page.</li>
</ol>

<p>I include a JavaScript file on every page on this site as follows:</p>

<pre>
&lt;script src="../quirksmode.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>Now whenever the page is loaded, the browser also puts the script in the file
<em>quirksmode.js</em> in the page. Note that you do <em>not</em> see the script in your source
code, you just see the include tag. Nonetheless the functions and variables in the
included file are available to scripts on each page.</p>

<p>I use this include for scripts that I want available on each page, like the
<a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/dom/toc.html">TOC</a> script. To view the include, download
<a href="../quirksmode.js">http://www.quirksmode.org/quirksmode.js</a>.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
<!--
function doIt()
{
	if (self.testIt) testIt();
	else alert('JavaScript Includes not supported!');
}
// -->
</script>

<p>On this page I include a special script that contains the function <code>testIt()</code>.
<a href="javascript:doIt()">Try executing it</a> to test your browser's support of includes.</p>


<h4>Avoiding errors in ancient browsers</h4>

<p>Do <em>not</em> put a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in the included file, just the raw
JavaScript code. <em>Always</em> place the include in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. Netscape 3.01
has grave trouble with code included anywhere else. In addition, configure the server
to send MIME type <code>application/x-javascript</code> with the .js file. Any other type
causes Netscape 3 (at least, maybe more browsers) to ask the user whether he wants to download
or open the file, no doubt causing tons of confusion.</p>

<p>Do <em>not</em> add an ID to a  <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. While it is allowed in Explorer,
adding 'ID' to the tag disables the tag in Netscape 4, so that the script isn't executed.</p>

<p>If you want to make sure that browsers that don't support includes don't give error messages,
you can do either of the following. Suppose you include the function <code>lastMod()</code> in each page.
When you call it, first check if it exists:</p>

<pre>
if (self.lastMod) document.write(lastMod())
</pre>

<p>Another method would be</p>

<pre>
&lt;script&gt;
function lastmod() {}
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="js.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>First define an empty function <code>lastMod()</code>, if includes are supported it is overwritten by
the actual function. Thus the function always exists, even if it does nothing in ancient browsers.</p>

<a name="noscript"></a>
<h3>&lt;noscript&gt;</h3>

<div class="floater">
<p><code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> is not supported by Netscape 2.</p>
</div>

<p>Within the <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tag you can put some HTML that will only be shown when the browser
of your users does not support JavaScript or has JavaScript disabled. It's occasionally useful to say
sorry to non-JavaScript users or to present an alternative to them.</p>

<p>The tag works as follows: No-script browsers do not know it, so they ignore it and print out
whatever's between them. Script browsers know it and don't show the bit inside the tag when
JavaScript is enabled.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Netscape 2 doesn't support this useful tag, so that Netscape 2 users will see
both the script and the noscript version. There's nothing you can do about it. Fortunately Netscape
2 isn't widely used any more.</p>

<h3>The defer attribute</h3>

<div class="floater">
<p>Only in Explorer 4+ on Windows the <code>defer</code> attribute defers executing the script until
the document has been parsed completely.</p>
</div>

<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/scripts.html#h-18.2.1"
	class="external" >W3C HTML 4.0 specification</a> specifies the <code>defer</code> attribute for
script tags:</p>

<pre>
&lt;script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" defer&gt;
</pre>

<p>Originally, this is nothing more than a hint to the browser that the script inside the tags does not modify
the content of the web page (by doing a <code>document.write</code>, for instance). Therefore the browser does
not need to wait for the entire script to be parsed and evaluated, it can immediately go on parsing the HTML.
On older systems this might save some parsing time.</p>

<p>However, Explorer 4+ on Windows has slightly changed the meaning of <code>defer</code>. Any code inside
deferred script tags is only executed when the page has been parsed entirely. For instance, take</p>

<pre>
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" defer&gt;
&lt;!--
alert(document.forms[0].elements.length);
// --&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;form&gt;
&lt;input value="Bla"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</pre>

<p>Normally the <code>alert</code> would give an error: the document does not (yet) contain any form at the moment
it is executed. By adding <code>defer</code> to the script tag, however, the alert is deferred until after parsing
and correctly gives 1 as the length of the form.</p>

<h3>Deprecated: Direct JavaScripts</h3>

<div class="floater">
<p>Do not use direct JavaScripts for the reasons explained in section 2C of <a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/book/">the book</a>.
This section is only maintained for historical reasons.</p>
</div>

<p>The simplest method is to place your scripts directly in the page.</p>

<h4>How to place</h4>

<pre>
&lt;script language="javascript" type="text/javascript"&gt;
&lt;!--

script goes here

// --&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>First, you tell the browser that a script is coming, that it's a JavaScript and that
the MIME-type is "text/javascript". Most validators protest against leaving the <code>TYPE</code>
out, but browsers execute the code anyway.</p>

<pre>
&lt;script language="javascript" type="text/javascript"&gt;
</pre>

<p>Then you open an HTML-comment. This is to protect very old browsers that don't recognize the &lt;script&gt;-tag.
They'll ignore the tags themselves, but they print out anything that's between them: the
script itself. Since this is incomprehensible to most users and doesn't have anything to do
with the content of the page, it's necessary to comment the script out.</p>

<pre>
&lt;!--
</pre>

<p>Then comes the script itself. After that it's necessary to close the HTML-comment again. However,
if you'd just type</p>

<pre class="wrong">
--&gt;
</pre>

<p>browsers that do understand JavaScript will try to interpret this as a JavaScript command. Of course, it isn't, so they give
<em>JavaScript Error Message Alerts</em>.<br />
Therefore, it is necessary to put the HTML-end-comment after a JavaScript comment (<code>//</code>).</p>

<pre>
// --&gt;
</pre>

<p>Finally, end the script and return to normal HTML.</p>

<pre>
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<h4>Where to place</h4>

<p>Generally you place JavaScripts in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of a page. Only when
you want to write a message in the page, you'll have to place the script in the correct place in the HTML.</p>

<p>Placing scripts in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> makes sure that any functions are loaded before the buttons,
links or other things that call them are loaded. If you put your scripts at the very end of a page, it is possible that a user already
sees part of the page including a button with a JavaScript function call, while the rest of the page hasn't loaded yet. Result: user pushes
button and gets <em>JavaScript Error Message Alerts</em>, because the browser can't find the script (yet).</p>

<p>Unless there's a good reason to do otherwise, place your scripts in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code></p>
