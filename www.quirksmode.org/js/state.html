With <code>if()</code> you can check conditions, while <code>for()</code> allowsyou to go through a set of data and do the same with each piece of data. Both are very commonstatements and you should know how they work.</p><p>These statements are common to all programminglanguages, so if you understand them for JavaScript, you understand them for all other languagesand never have to learn the concepts again, only the specific syntax of the programming language.</p><p>At the moment I explain the following statements:</p><ul><li><a class="page" href="#if">if ()</a></li><li><a class="page" href="#for">for ()</a></li></ul><h3 id="if">The if() statement</h3><p>Code like this:</p><pre>if (something is the case) {	more JavaScript commands}</pre><p>is used when you want to execute some code only if a specific condition is met.</p><h4>if ()</h4><p>For instance,suppose you read out the annual income of a user from a <a href="forms.html">form</a> and put it in the variable <code>income</code>.Now if the income is over $100,000, you want to inform the user of some special benefit for peoplewith large incomes. Then the code becomes:</p><pre>var income = [read out from form]if (income > 100000) {	alert('We can offer you a special benefit.');	(more code)}</pre><p>The code is very simple: you take <code>income</code> and compare it to 100000. If it's larger, soif the condition (<code>income > 100000</code>) is met, the code between the curly brackets <code>{}</code>is executed. If the condition is not met, nothing happens.</p><p class="smaller">See the <a href="boolean.html" >Boolean logic</a> page for a description of how conditionslike this one work.</p><h4>else if ()</h4><p>Now suppose you also want to see if the user has a house of his own. If he does but still has anincome less than $100,000 you want to inform him of some other interesting possibilities.</p><p>If you want to check for <code>ownhouse</code> only if <code>income</code> is not larger than $100,000you have to use this code:</p><pre>var income = [read out from form]var ownhouse = [read out from form, value is 'Yes' or 'No']if (income > 100000) {	alert('We can offer you a special benefit.');	(more code)}else if (ownhouse == 'Yes') {	alert('We still have some offers');	(more code)}</pre><p>With <code>if - else if</code> you can define various conditions that are checked one afteranother until the script finds a true condition. Then the block below the true condition isexecuted. After one block is executed the script ignores any subesquent <code>else if</code>'s.</p><p>In this case the script first checks if <code>income</code> is larger than 100000. If it isn't, it thenchecks (<code>else if</code>) if the user owns a house.</p><p>So in an if-else if construction there are four possibilities:</p><ol><li>Only the <em>first</em> condition is met: the first block of code is executed</li><li>Only the <em>second</em> condition is met: the second block of code is executed</li><li><em>Both</em> conditions are met: only the first block of code is executed.</li><li><em>Neither</em> condition is met: nothing happens</li></ol><p>Of course you can use as many <code>else if</code>s as necessary.</p><h4>else</h4><p>Now suppose that you want to say sorry to those people who have an income less than $100,000and have no house. You can add the following code below the last <code>else if</code>:</p><pre>else {	alert ('sorry');	(more code)}</pre><p>This <code>else</code> means: in all other cases. If none of the above conditions are met, thisblock of code is executed.</p><h4>Comparision of values</h4><p>Usually in an <code>if</code> statement you want to compare two strings or numbers. You do thisas follows:</p><ul><li><em>Larger</em> than: if (income > 100000)</li><li><em>Smaller</em> than: if (income < 100000)</li><li><em>Larger</em> than or <em>equal</em> to: if (income >= 100000)</li><li><em>Smaller</em> than or <em>equal</em> to: if (income <= 100000)</li><li><em>Equal</em> to: if (income == 100000) (<span class="smaller">note the double equation mark: <code>==</code>)</span></li><li><em>Not equal</em> to: if (income != 100000)</li></ul><p>If you want to compare strings, be sure to always write the string between single quotes, like:</p><pre>if (ownhouse == 'Yes') {	alert('We still have some offers');	(more code)}</pre><p>If you leave out the quotes, JavaScript thinks that you want to compare the value of the variable<code>ownhouse</code> with the value of the variable <code>Yes</code>.</p><pre class="wrong">if (ownhouse == Yes) {	alert('We still have some offers');	(more code)}</pre><p>If you haven't declared a variable <code>Yes</code> strange errors can creep up.</p><h4>Seeing if objects exist</h4><p>You can also see if an object exists:</p><pre>if (document.images) {	do something with document.images}</pre><p>If the object document.images exists, the condition becomes <code>true</code> and the block of codeis executed.</p><p class="smaller">The <a href="support.html">Object detection</a> page explains why you shoulddo this.</p><h3 id="for">The for () statement</h3><p>This block of code</p><pre>for (var i=0;i&lt;5;i++) {	alert('i = ' + i);}</pre><p>is a <code>for</code> loop that gives alerts with the numbers 0,1,2,3 and 4.<a href="javascript:tryit()" class="page">Try</a> it to see what it does.</p><script type="text/javascript"><!--function tryit() {	for (var i=0;i<5;i++) 	{		alert('i = ' + i);	}}// --></script><p>As you can see, the alert gives the value of <code>i</code> and this value goes from0 to 4. This is caused by the <code>for</code> statement:</p><pre>for (var i=0;i&lt;5;i++)</pre><p>This means: the variable <code>i</code> starts at 0 (<code>var i=0;</code>), the for loopgoes on as long as <code>i</code> is less than 5 (<code>i&lt;5</code>) and <code>i</code> isincreased by one each time the loop is done again (<code>i++</code>).</p><p>In practice, that means that the code between the curly brackets <code>{}</code> isexecuted with <code>i=0</code>, then with <code>i=1</code> etc. until <code>i=4</code>. Whenit increases <code>i</code> to 5, the code sees that the condition <code>i&lt;5</code> isno longer met and it stops the loop.</p><p>So the <code>for</code> statement is used to execute the same code a couple of timeswith each time a different value of <code>i</code>. You will use this statement mainlyif you want to go through an array and do the same thing with each ofthe elements.</p><p class="smaller">By saying <code>var i</code> you declare a new, local variable for this for loop only.Sometimes it's very important to declare it as such because the program can get confusedif you use the variable <code>i</code> more than once. By explicitly declaring it you confineit to this for loop only, as soon as it's done the variable is removed from the programmemory. This avoids all potential confusion.</p><p>You can also put an <code>if</code> inside a <code>for</code>, like:</p><pre>for (var i=0;i&lt;5;i++) {	if (thearray[i] == 'Yes') {		(do something)	}}</pre><p>Now the code takes all elements from the array <code>thearray</code> and for eachone checks if the value is <code>Yes</code>. If it is, the innermost block of codeis executed.</p><p>Of course, you can also go from 4 to 0 backwards:</p><pre>for (var i=4;i&gt;=0;i--)</pre><p>or from 0 to 10 in steps of 2</p><pre>for (var i=0;i<11;i+=2)</pre><p>or anything else that's necessary.</p><p>A related statement is <code>for (var i in object)</code>. This does the same, except that yougo through all the properties of an object. This statement is explained on the<a href="associative.html">associative arrays</a> page.</p><div id="footer"><a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/home.html">Home</a> <a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/sitemap.html">Sitemap</a><p id="validation" class="smaller">Valid XHTML 1.0</p></div></body>
