You'll use them a lot, since mostthings you can read out (the URL of a page, a style sheet declaration, the value of a form field) are strings.</p><p>First I explain the <a href="#basics" class="page">basics</a> of strings. Then I explain the fuzzy line between<a href="#stringnum" class="page">strings and numbers</a> in JavaScript. If you have programming experience inanother language, please read this part carefully.<br />Finally I give some of the most important <a href="#methprop" class="page">methods and properties</a> of strings.</p><h3 id="basics">String basics</h3><p>Let's review the basics of strings.</p><h4>Quotes</h4><p>When you declare and manipulate strings in JavaScript, always write them with single quotes ' or double quotes "around them. This tells the browser that it's dealing with a string. Don't mix up your quotes, if you start a stringwith a single quote and end it with a double quote, JavaScript doesn't understand what you mean. As a rule,I use single quotes ' because I've decided to use double quotes for HTML and single quotes for JavaScript.You can of course do this the other way around, but I advise you to make some such rule for yourself.</p><p>Let's introduce our two test strings that we'll use throughout this page:</p><pre>var a = 'Hello world!';var b = 'I am a JavaScript hacker.'</pre><p>Now we have declared two variables, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and put strings in them. Having done this, we canstart working with them. But first of all, a problem: suppose I'd written</p><pre>var b = 'I'm a JavaScript hacker.';</pre><p>This string has a single quote in it, so JavaScript thinks that the string ends, doesn't understand what comes nextand gives error messages. So you need to <em>escape</em> the single quote, telling the browser to treat the quote asa character, and not as a command to end the string. This is done by placing a backslash \ before it:</p><pre>var b = 'I\'m a JavaScript hacker.'</pre><p>Note that you can put double quotes in the string without escaping them. After all, you've defined the single quotesas the beginning and end of the string, so</p><pre>var b = 'I\'m a JavaScript "hacker".'</pre><p>gives no problems. The double quotes are automatically treated as parts of the string, not as commands.</p><h4>Pre-written functions</h4><p>Now that you've defined the strings, you can start using them. For instance, you can append one string to another,you can take the second to fourth character of <code>b</code> and put them in the middle of string <code>a</code>, you canread out what the twelfth character of <code>a</code> is, how many characters <code>b</code> has, if there's a 'q' inthem and many more things.</p><p>To do this, you can use some automatic functions that JavaScript assigns to each string. One of them is<code>.length</code> that gives the length of the string. So if you want to get the length of 'Hello world!' you can do:</p><pre>var c = 'Hello world!'.length;</pre><p>But above we put this string in the variable <code>a</code>. Thereby you make <code>a</code> a string, so it also has a<code>length</code> and this yields the same result:</p><pre>var c = a.length;</pre><p>The important thing is that you can use <code>.length</code> on any string: it's an automatic feature. You can read outthe <code>length</code> of any string, whether JavaScript makes it for you (like location.href or document.title) oryou have declared it yourself.<br />I give a list of common automatical methods and properties <a href="#methprop" class="page">below</a>.</p><h3 id="stringnum">Strings and numbers</h3><p>JavaScript is very relaxed about the difference between strings and numbers. Some programming languagesrequire you to state if a variable is a number or a string before doing anything else with it. Not so in JavaScript.In fact you can even add up numbers and strings:</p><pre>var c = a + 12;</pre><p>Some programming languages would shut down in disgust when they encounter this line. After all, <code>a</code> is a stringand <code>12</code> is a number. JavaScript, however, tries to solve the problem by assuming <code>12</code> is also a string. So<code>c</code> becomes</p><pre>Hello world!12</pre><p>So if you use <code>+</code> on a string and a number, JavaScript is going to make the number a string for you. Betterstill, if you need it you can treat numbers as strings or strings as numbers.</p><p>Conversely, if you apply mathematics to a string, JavaScript tries to make it a number. If the string cannot beinterpreted as a number (because there are letters in it, for instance), JavaScript gives <code>NaN</code> (Not a Number).</p><p>Finally, JavaScript makes no reliable difference between integers and floating point variables.</p><h4>Number to string</h4><div class="floater"><p><code>toString()</code> does not work in Netscape 2 and Explorer 3.</p></div><p>To convert a number to a string, do:</p><pre>var c = (16 * 24)/49 + 12;d = c.toString();</pre><p>Now you can use all methods of strings on <code>d</code>, while <code>c</code> still contains the number.</p><h4>String to number</h4><p>If you want to change a string to a number, first make sure there are only the characters 0-9 in the string. WhatI always do is simply multiplying the string by 1.</p><pre>var c = '1234';d = c * 1;</pre><p>Since multiplying assumes numbers, JavaScript makes the string a number, if possible. If that isn't possible, theresult is <code>NaN</code>. Note that you cannot do</p><pre>var c = '1234';d = c + 0;</pre><p>This would yield '12340' because JavaScript thinks the <code>+</code> means <em>concatenate string</em>, not <em>add</em>.</p><h3 id="methprop">String methods and properties</h3><p>So what can we do with strings? Here's a list of automatic JavaScript commands. The concatenation is aspecial case, but all other commands can be used on any string by doing <code>stringname.command()</code>.</p><ul><li><a href="#conc" class="page">Concatenating strings (+)</a></li><li><a href="#indexof" class="page">indexOf</a></li><li><a href="#lindexof" class="page">lastIndexOf</a></li><li><a href="#charat" class="page">charAt</a></li><li><a href="#length" class="page">length</a></li><li><a href="#split" class="page">split</a></li><li><a href="#substring" class="page">substring</a></li><li><a href="#substr" class="page">substr</a></li><li><a href="#tocase" class="page">toLowerCase and toUpperCase</a></li></ul><h4 id="conc">Concatenating strings (+)</h4><p>First of all, you can concatenate strings, sew them together as it were:</p><pre>document.write(a + b);</pre><p>gives</p><pre>Hello world!I am a JavaScript hacker.</pre><p>But of course you want a space between the two sentences. No problem. By doing</p><pre>document.write(a + ' ' + b);</pre><p>we concatenate three strings: <code>a</code>, ' '  (one space) and <code>b</code> and we get</p><pre>Hello world! I am a JavaScript hacker.</pre><p>You can even use numbers or calculations, like:</p><pre>document.write (a + 3*3 + b);</pre><p>Now we concatenate string <code>a</code>, then the result of <code>3*3</code>, treated as a stringfor the occasion, and then <code>b</code>, which gives</p><pre>Hello world!9I am a JavaScript hacker.</pre><p>Watch out if you want to add numbers. This</p><pre>document.write (a + 3+3 + b);</pre><p>concatenates four strings: <code>a</code>, 3, 3 and <code>b</code>, because <code>+</code> in this context means<em>concatenate strings</em>, not <em>add</em>, and gives</p><pre>Hello world!33I am a JavaScript hacker.</pre><p>Use brackets if you want to add 3 and 3 before making the string.</p><pre>document.write (a + (3+3) + b);</pre><p>concatenates <code>a</code>, the result of <code>3+3</code> and <code>b</code> and gives</p><pre>Hello world!6I am a JavaScript hacker.</pre><h4 id="indexof">indexOf</h4><p>One of the most widely used automatical methods is <code>indexOf</code>. Each character has an <em>index</em>number, giving its position in the string. Note that the first character has index 0, the second one index1 etc. So the index of 'w' in string <code>a</code> is 6.</p><p>Using <code>indexOf</code> we can read out the index number of a character. Put the <code>.indexOf('')</code> behindthe string name and put the character you're looking for between the quotes. This</p><pre>var a = 'Hello world!';document.write(a.indexOf('w'))</pre><p>gives <code>6</code>. If the same character occurs more than once, this method gives the first occurrence. So</p><pre>document.write(a.indexOf('o'))</pre><p>gives <code>4</code> because that's the index of the first 'o' in the string.</p><p>You can also look for a combination of characters <span class="smaller">(This is of course also astring, but to prevent confusion I won't call it so)</span>. <code>indexOf</code> returns the position of the first characterof the combination. So</p><pre>document.write(a.indexOf('o w'))</pre><p>also gives <code>4</code> because that's the index of the 'o'.</p><p>Furthermore it's possible to search for a character only after a certain index number. For instance, if you'd do</p><pre>document.write(a.indexOf('o',5));</pre><p>you get the index number of the first 'o' coming after the character with index 5 (= the space), so it wouldgive 7.</p><p>Finally, if the character or combination is not present in the string, <code>indexOf</code> gives <code>-1</code>. Thisis actually the widest use of <code>indexOf</code>: seeing if a certain combination of characters is present. It's thecore of the <a href="detect.html">browser detect</a> script. To see if the browser is Explorer, you take thestring <code>navigator.userAgent</code> and see if it contains 'MSIE':</p><pre>if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf('MSIE') !=-1){	do something for Explorer}</pre><p>If the index number of 'MSIE' is <em>not</em> -1 (if 'MSIE' occurs anywhere in the string), the browser is Explorer.</p><h4 id="lindexof">lastIndexOf</h4><p>There's also <code>lastIndexOf</code> which gives the last occurrence of the character or combination.  It otherwiseworks exactly as <code>indexOf</code>. This</p><pre>var b = 'I am a JavaScript hacker.'document.write(b.lastIndexOf('a'))</pre><p>gives <code>19</code> because that's the index of the last 'a' in the string.</p><!-- p>There's no automatical way to read the index of characters other than the first or the last. <em>b.indexOf('a')</em>gives 2, <em>b.lastIndexOf('a')</em> gives 19, but to find the positions of the other 3 a's you need to write yourown script.</P --><h4 id="charat">charAt</h4><p><code>charAt()</code> gives you the character at a certain position. For instance, when you do</p><pre>var b = 'I am a JavaScript hacker.'document.write(b.charAt(5))</pre><p>gives 'a', because that's the character at the sixth position (remember, first character is 0!).</p><h4 id="length">length</h4><p><code>length</code> gives you the length of a string.</p><pre>var b = 'I am a JavaScript hacker.'document.write(b.length)</pre><p>gives 25. Note that the length is 1 more than the index number of the last character.</p><h4 id="split">split</h4><div class="floater"><p><code>split()</code> does not work in Netscape 2 and Explorer 3.</p></div><p><code>split()</code> is a specialized method that you need sometimes. It allows you to split a string at the placesof a certain character. You must put the result in an array, not in a simple variable. Let's split <code>b</code> on thespaces.</p><pre>var b = 'I am a JavaScript hacker.'var temp = new Array();temp = b.split(' ');</pre><p>Now the string has been split into 5 strings that are placed in the array <code>temp</code>. The spaces themselves aregone.</p><pre>temp[0] = 'I';temp[1] = 'am';temp[2] = 'a';temp[3] = 'JavaScript';temp[4] = 'hacker.';</pre><h4 id="substring">substring</h4><p><code>substring</code> is used to take a part of a string. Syntax is <code>substring(first_index,last_index)</code>. So forinstance</p><pre>var a = 'Hello world!';document.write(a.substring(4,8));</pre><p>gives 'o wo', from the first 'o' (index 4) to the second one (index 7) Note that the 'r' (index 8) is <em>not</em>part of this substring.</p><p>You can also do</p><pre>var a = 'Hello world!';document.write(a.substring(4));</pre><p>This gives the whole string from the character with index 4 on: 'o world!'.</p><h4 id="substr">substr</h4><div class="floater"><p><code>substr()</code> is not supported by Netscape 2 and 3, Explorer 3, Hotjava 3, Opera 3 and WebTV.</p></div><p>There is also a method <code>substr()</code> that works slightly differently. Instead of the second number being an index number,it gives the number of characters. So</p><pre>document.write(a.substr(4,8));</pre><p>starts at the character with index 4 ('o') and then gives 8 characters, so the output is</p><pre>o world!</pre><p>Since <code>substr()</code> is not supported by the Version 3 browsers I never use it.</p><h4 id="tocase">toLowerCase and toUpperCase</h4><p>Finally two methods that you need sometimes: <code>toLowerCase()</code> puts the whole string in lower case,<code>toUpperCase()</code> puts the whole string in upper case.</p><pre>var b = 'I am a JavaScript hacker.'document.write(b.toUpperCase())</pre><p>gives 'I AM A JAVASCRIPT HACKER.'.</p><div id="footer"><a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/home.html">Home</a> <a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/sitemap.html">Sitemap</a><p class="smaller" id="validation">Valid XHTML 1.0</p></div></body>
